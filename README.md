### Project Description
This website is used to enter a name of someone and the website would make it look like that person is calling you..
iIt takes 5 sec to show the call and when you answer or decline il will again come to the home page.You could again enter new name.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People sometimes need a fake phone call for fun, pranks, or to escape awkward situations. There‚Äôs no simple online tool to trigger a realistic fake call with a timer and sound.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A simple website where you enter a name, wait 5 seconds, and boom ‚Äî a fake phone call appears with ringtone and caller name. Just for laughs, pranks, or a sneaky escape!
